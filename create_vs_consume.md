I spend an unreasonable amount of my time reading Hacker News articles. When I open my browser, muscle memory has me typing “hackern” before I even realise what’s happening. I’m doing it right now - while writing this blog, I’ve already alt-tabbed and read a couple of links. And I’ve only written 50 words... 


It’s very easy to consume content. Thanks to the wonders of aggregation sites like reddit, HN and so forth, a curated selection of interesting material is always a click away. News articles, editorials, instructional guides and the like are served up to me in a constant, ever-refreshing stream. More information than I could ever hope to read - even if I were to dedicate all of my waking hours to browsing. There would always be another link to click, another blog article describing the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript, another dramatically-titled post portending the death of a technology. It never stops.


In one respect, the vast wealth of facts and opinions at our fingertips is a blessing. We enjoy an access to information of which previous generations could never have conceived. But at the same time as it enlightens us, such ease of access can also trivialise individual contributions - devalue them. How often have you clicked on a link, skim-read the first three sentences and thought “Boring. Wordy. Unimaginative”, before proceeding to the next item in endless line? It’s easy to slip into the mindset that there is always something better to read. And perhaps there is, but this mentality can lead to a state where you are gleaning almost nothing from an evening’s browsing; simply skipping from article to article without absorbing anything.


It would be better to limit yourself to reading five items, considering them fully and giving them the time and mental effort they deserve. Much better than reading the first paragraph of a hundred tech blogs and news articles. However, this distracts from a deeper consideration. Better still, instead of consuming content, we should be dedicating our time to creating. 


Achieving success in your personal field - whether that means financial success, acclaim in a  community or some other definition - rarely comes from absorption. Information you consume might make you smarter or better-prepared, but until you apply your knowledge it brings little to the table in terms of concrete value. The fact is that people are judged on what they do, not just what they know - how can anyone value you for your knowledge if you don’t present it in some way? Think of the figures who are household names in the tech world, the business world. Why are they known and respected? It’s because they create; they DO.


Unfortunately, creating is hard. Let’s think why:


1. Before you create, you need to know something of value to others
2. You can’t just regurgitate knowledge; you have to add value either through delivery or insight
3. By creating something, you open yourself up to criticism


So much easier to sit back and consume! There are few risks associated with reading other people’s ideas. However, there is also a certainty that if you don’t make anything, you won’t... well, make anything. 


I’m not advocating that all of us disregard existing knowledge and wisdom and simply venture off into realms unknown. To make anything of value, we need to learn, as much from others as from ourselves. However, my personal goal - and the purpose of this article - is to attempt to even the balance between consumption and creation. If for every hundred insightful articles I read, for every ten open-source code libraries that I use, I can create one of my own, then I will be satisfied. I will be on the way to being more than just a bystander.


The next time you find yourself idly browsing, stop and think: “Is there something that I could be creating right now?” Whether it’s code, writing, drawing, interpretive dance, anything - stop waiting, stop consuming and go and make it.
