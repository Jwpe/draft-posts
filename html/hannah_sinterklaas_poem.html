<p>In Dutch Sinterklaas there exists a tradition,
Where gifts are addressed by poetic submission,
In which the recipient's name is concealed,
And will, for the reader, be duly revealed. </p><p>This girl's both an Anglo- and Francophile;
She's been known to run an 8.19 minute mile.
And when she's not moving extremely fast,
Her vocation is studying art from the past.   </p><p>In the course of her studies she gazes at rocks,
And occasionally pictures of giant black... Rothko paintings.
She frequently contemplates methods and murder, 
But spends much of her day as a small greyhound herder.</p><p>When it comes to refreshment she's partial to gin,
Though drinking Chianti's considered a sin.
While travelling Europe she looks out for sheep,
Although frequently misses them 'cause she's asleep.</p><p>All in all this lady's a true Southern belle,
Extensively-travelled, and worldly as well.
So we reach our conclusion in round-about manner,
It should now be clear that these gifts are for ____</p><p>-- Sint</p>
