<p>This afternoon, I was thinking about intelligence/cognitive ability/mental quickness/pattern recognition and decided to investigate the options for free intelligence tests available online. I am fully aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Criticism_and_views">limited scope of IQ tests and their ilk</a>, but nonetheless I was interested to see if there were any online quizzes I could do with immediate results. </p><p>I’d encountered Raven’s Progressive Matrices when they were briefly described by Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers, and I was interested to see what a full test looked like, as well as what it was supposed to measure. A quick Google led me to <a href="http://www.raventest.net">www.raventest.net</a>, an online test using the Standard version of the progressive matrices. According to the homepage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raven's Progressive Matrices (Raven's matrices, "the best and most popular intelligence test of all time" - wikipedia) are non-verbal multiple choice measures of the general intelligence, in each test item, the subject is asked to identify the missing element that completes a pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was also told that the test would consist of 60 questions and would last for 40 minutes, and asked “NOT [to] share or publish answers at any time with any other person”. Fair enough. A maximum 40-minute time investment to measure my pattern recognition seemed like a reasonable choice on a Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Admittedly, the prominent ad banner and overall lack of site polish should have forewarned me of what was to come. However, I naively ploughed through the 60 questions, interested to see what the results of this test would be and whether they would tell me anything interesting about my cognition. Fortunately, after substantially less than 40 minutes I reached the final question. I was asked to submit my age, and proceeded to the results page where I was greeted with the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your Complete Raven Test Report has been generated and can be accessed immediately for ONLY: €19.95 (€125 - €250 at other places - Save up to 92%).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rather jarring statement was accompanied by a PayPal Buy button. </p><p>Needless to say, I was frustrated to find that I’d just wasted time and effort to discover absolutely nothing. I wanted to waste time and effort to discover a relatively trivial number that might correlate with my intelligence, damn it! While the site hadn’t specifically claimed to be free, I thought it was mighty cheeky of them to demand cash after my up-to-40-minute time investment. I don’t generally approve of underhanded tactics for parting people from their money, and so I began to brood on how I could exact my revenge.</p><p>I was temporarily stumped. However, I’d come too far to be defeated. I wondered if there were any way to access my results without shelling out 20 EUR - albeit at an up to 92% discount. I inspected the page source for any evidence of my score. Nothing, no hidden div tags. My second guess was more fruitful, however. In the page request header I discovered a very interesting session cookie. As well as containing my session ID, there were several variables named ketqua1, ketqua2 and so forth, up to ketqua10. These variables appeared to have been assigned numbers between 0 and 6. Curiouser and curiouser, given that the test had contained 10 pages, each with 6 questions. </p><p>With one final cognitive leap - which I’m sure the owners of raventest anticipated as a secret, bonus part of the test - I was able to calculate my Raven Standard Progressive Matrix score for free! Hurrah! </p><p>*</p><p>The moral of the story is as follows -  if you wish to part people with their time in the interests of subsequently parting them with their money, make sure you at least do it properly.</p>
