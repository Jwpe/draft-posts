<p>Sublime Text 2 is my favourite editor for coding. Admittedly, my experience with editors is far from exhaustive. I know that there are many exciting editors and IDEs available to the modern programmer, many of which I haven’t explored. However, I have been using Sublime for a long time - the better part of a year - and it has yet to let me down in functionality. If you’re sick of Notepad or TextMate, and not quite prepared for the <a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">vim learning curve</a>, you should definitely try it out. With a free, time-unlimited evaluation copy available, there’s no reason not to.</p><p>One of the things I love about Sublime is the plug-and-play style with which you can add packages. These packages do everything from <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2">changing the theme of the editor</a>, to allowing <a href="https://github.com/surjikal/sublime-coffee-compile">compiling of code in-editor</a>, to checking if your code is correctly formatted. Essentially, it’s very easy to tweak Sublime’s functionality to suit your needs.</p><p>Packages live in a hidden directory (.config/sublime-text-2/Packages in your home directory on Ubuntu) and can easily be installed by grabbing them from github and putting them straight into the directory. “Github?” I hear you cry - “Directories? That’s much too complicated and confusing for me!”* Never fear: thanks to one package in particular, installation of subsequent packages can be rendered so simple that you don’t even need to leave the editor to do it.</p><p>*I assume you won’t actually be crying this. However, everyone loves simplicity.</p><p>Enter Sublime Package Control, arguably the king of packages. If you’re using Sublime and you don’t have it, <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation">install it now</a>.</p><p>Right, done? Now, let’s go through installing a package from within Sublime. Open the editor and hit Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to open up the Command Palette. Start typing “package” into the search box, and you’ll be greeted with a variety of Package Control commands. Find and select Package Control: Install Package. You’ll be greeted with a searchable list of installable packages.</p><p><img src="https://jwpevans.s3.amazonaws.com/images/package_manager.png" alt="Sublime Text 2 Package Manager"></p><p><img src="https://jwpevans.s3.amazonaws.com/images/select_package.png" alt="Select Package"></p><p>Let’s try installing one! Choose a package which sounds useful to you. I chose Python Flake8 Lint, which checks your Python syntax for errors and compliance to PEP8. Select it, and you’ll see a progress message magically appear in the bottom bar, followed quickly by a success message.</p><p><img src="https://jwpevans.s3.amazonaws.com/images/installing_package.png" alt="Installing Package"></p><p>And that’s it. Your new package is installed. Thanks, Sublime Package Control! </p><p>Know any other cool Sublime Text 2 tricks? Want to rant about how <em>insert editor here</em> is way better?
