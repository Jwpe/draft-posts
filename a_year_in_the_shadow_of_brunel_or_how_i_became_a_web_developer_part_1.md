
One year ago, I made the decision to move to Bristol to pursue a career as a web developer and entrepreneur. This is a gripping account of what brought me to this veritable pivot-point, and the earth-shattering implications of my choice. Also, there may be some hyperbole.

In the summer of 2011, I graduated from Cambridge University with a Masters in Engineering and a shaky sense of my own self-worth. As I probably should have expected - but of course didn’t - university was incredibly challenging. By the end of my fourth year my dreams of academic achievement had been supplanted by a sense of relief that I would leave with a degree. Having dedicated most of my time during the year to worrying about studying, with the occasional burst of actual studying, I reached my graduation day with no real plans for the future. I’d heard rumour that having a job was a recommended course of action for graduates, but I’d so far failed to make any meaningful progress towards getting one. This left me with a pressing question: what next?




As I embarked on this new and exciting phase of my life, I had two major goals:




1. Find a way to sustain myself financially




2. Prove, mostly to myself, that I was capable of working hard and being good at something
 
Fortunately, thanks to the amazing kindness and support of my parents, I was not in a position of having to find a place to live and a source of income immediately. However, I was eager to be doing something useful and productive, so I considered my options. My list looked something like this:




1. Get a job in the engineering industry
2. Get a job in consultancy
3. Follow my dreams and start a business with my close friend and fellow engineering graduate Cameron
…
101. Further education




The first of my options didn’t appeal to me as much as it once would have. After my university experiences, I was suffering from a serious lack of enthusiasm for engineering. Option 2 seemed financially appealing but I wasn’t that wild about the prospect of leveraging synergy or enabling deliverables. This left the third option - by far the least practical in terms of money, but definitely the most exciting. 




Cameron studied at the University of Warwick, where he had achieved great academic success. Getting first class honours every year of your degree is no mean feat. With his grades, he could have probably walked in to any job he desired, but luckily for me he was more interested in starting a business. He and I had talked during university about the prospect of forming a company, and over the summer after graduation our discussions became more serious. We weren’t sure quite what we wanted to do, but we were damn sure that we wanted to do it. Gradually our purpose crystallised - we would teach ourselves to program and become web entrepreneurs. A lofty goal no doubt, but we were excited and motivated by the prospect of working for ourselves, and we began to look around for the best way to go about it. A bit of research led us to something called Django.




“Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design” - the Django Project website




We were sold. We began blundering about with tutorials, reading blog posts and the Django Book, and attempting to bend Python to our will. Thanks to the clarity of the language, this process was surprisingly forgiving and we began to make baby steps towards creating our first web application. In hindsight, our decision to choose Django as our framework was an excellent and fortuitous one which has afforded us many opportunities. We didn’t know this at the time - all we knew was that we were making websites and it was very cool. 




After the summer, I was intending to return to Cambridge to share a house with friends from university who were working in the city. Cameron had decided to move to Bristol. We planned to work on our nascent business remotely, and see how things went.  Whether this would have worked at all, I don’t know. However, fortunately for the success of our endeavours, in late August I had a discussion with my grandfather about my future. It went something like this:




Jonathan: “[lengthy explanation of why I wanted to be a web entrepreneur]... So I’ll go back to Cambridge and I’ll work on the business from there, and Cameron will work on it from Bristol, and hopefully it will grow into something!”




Grandfather: “Why are you going back to Cambridge?”




Jonathan: “...”




I realised that I didn’t have a good answer to his question. If I was serious about making the business idea work, surely I should be in the same place as my business-partner? In reality, the reason I was planning on returning to Cambridge was familiarity and friends. However, in the context of being successful, it really made no sense. I needed to fully commit myself to making the business a reality. To borrow from that modern poet, will.i.am, I could go hard, or I could go home.




After some serious evaluation, introspection, and lots of emails, I found myself on a train to Bristol in late September. I was doing what I had long dreamed of doing - setting off to create a business. But more than that, I was going into the unknown to find out what I was capable of, and I was thrilled.
